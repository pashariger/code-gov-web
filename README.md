## Introduction

[Code.gov](https://code.gov) is a website promoting good practices in code development, collaboration, and reuse across the U.S.  Government. Code.gov will provide tools and guidance to help agencies implement the [Federal Source Code Policy](https://sourcecode.cio.gov). It will include an inventory of the government's custom code to promote reuse between agencies and will provide tools to help government and the public collaborate on open source projects.

To learn more about the project, check out this [blog post](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/08/08/peoples-code).

Code.gov is an open source project, so we invite your contributions, be it in the form of code, design, or ideas.

## Project Timeline

The development of code.gov is guided by the requirements set forth in [Section 7.2 (Code Inventories and Discovery)](https://sourcecode.cio.gov/Implementation/#code-inventories-and-discovery), [Section 7.3 (Code.gov)](https://sourcecode.cio.gov/Implementation/#codegov), and  [Section 7.6 (Agency Policy)](https://sourcecode.cio.gov/Implementation/#agency-policy) of the Federal Source Code Policy. Namely:

    * "Within 90 days of the publication date of this policy, the Administration will launch https://www.code.gov, an online collection of tools, best practices, and schemas to help agencies implement this policy.";

    * "Within 90 days of the publication date of this policy, each agency’s CIO—in consultation with the agency’s CAO—shall develop an agency-wide policy that addresses the requirements of this [document.]";  and

    * "Within 120 days of the publication date of this policy, each agency must update—and thereafter keep up to date—its inventory of agency information resources to include an enterprise code inventory that lists custom-developed code for or by the agency after the publication of this policy."

Over the next few weeks, we will begin the *discovery sprint* for code.gov. During that time, we will conduct user interviews and engage this community in discussions that will inform the user experience for code.gov.

After the discovery sprint, we'll begin building the site. We'll be relying on input from the community and from agencies about what features should be delivered first. That list of features will drive the *design sprint* and *development sprint*. And because this site is being developed in the open, you will be able to make contributions and provide feedback here as we go.

## Questions?

If you have questions, please feel [free to open an issue here](https://github.com/presidential-innovation-fellows/code-gov-web/issues): [https://github.com/presidential-innovation-fellows/code-gov-web/issues](https://github.com/presidential-innovation-fellows/code-gov-web/issues) or send us an email at [code@listserv.gsa.gov].

## Getting Started

After you have cloned this repo, you can use `npm install` to install all of the
project’s dependencies.

You can then run the server using `npm start`.

## Testing
This app uses Karma + Jasmine to handle testing. Run `npm test` to execute
tests. To add tests, simply create a file with `.spec.ts` as the extension and
your tests will be included.

## Deployment
This app uses the `github-deploy` package for handling deployment. To configure
deployment, customize the `config/github-deploy` and `webpack.github-deploy`
files to match your settings. When ready to deploy, run
`npm run github-deploy:dev` or `npm run github-deploy:prod`, depending on your
intended destination.

## Generating License Data
To update the `dependency_licenses.json` file, run `npm run licenses`.

## File Structure
The directories in `src/app` are organized around the pillars of Angular, along
with several additional custom file types. When creating new files, be sure to
add your file and any necessary templates, styles, and tests to a directory
dedicated to your new file in the appropriate place.

For the most part, components are organized based on the navigation structure of
the app. For example, you can find Policy Guide content in
`src/app/components/policy-guide`.

## Component Structure
Most Components have a `style`, `template`, and `component` file. Template files
are composed of HTML with Angular syntax for inserting content and view
conditionals. Styles are encapsulated by default unless the Component has
`ViewEncapsulation` disabled, so global class names are generally not an issue.

## Style Guide
This app follows the
[official Angular Stlye Guide](https://angular.io/styleguide). Please ensure you
follow the naming conventions defined in this guide.
